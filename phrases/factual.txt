Yes, I am aware that these sorts of messages get posted quite a lot here, but I would like to say that as of right now, you %should probably %not %use %Sigma %client.

Most of Sigma's Hypixel %bypasses are %extremely %outdated, as [this](https://minecraft-hacking.fandom.com/wiki/Sigma_(Hacked_client)) wiki post shows. To quote it directly:
> Sigma "was" a great choice to hack on servers like Cubecraft, Mineplex, Hypixel, as it was updated to bypass anti-cheats. Unfortunately, due to the %demotivation %of %the %developers, it tends to get you %banned a lot more as the %bypasses arent up to date, now it's considered %outdated and %limited %support for servers.

If you *do* still want to %hack on Hypixel, you'll unfortunately need to fork out some cash to buy a ghost client like [Vape](https://www.vape.gg/), [Novoline](https://novoline.wtf), or [Astolfo](https://www.astolfo.lgbt/) as they have far better bypasses. ยง
Do **not** use Sigma client. Its main dev, Omnikron, has been previously known to [include a %botnet in his previous client,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ogf2Qis_7A) even with the files rather brazenly named %`MPayload` and %`MWorker` . ยง
You do realise there are plenty of clients other Sigma, right? Most of Sigma's modules aren't unique andmost of its %bypasses %no %longer %work.

Some %alternatives:
- 1.8: %Moon, %Novoline
- 1.12: %Liquidbounce, %Inertia
- 1.16: %Ares, %Meteor

Come on, you can do better than this. ยง
